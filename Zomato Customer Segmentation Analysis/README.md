# Zomato BI Analytics Project (Power BI)

## 📊 Project Overview
As part of the **onboarding process at Zomato**, I was tasked with performing a business intelligence analysis on company data.  
The objective was to explore **customer, restaurant, or sales dynamics** and present insights through an interactive **Power BI dashboard** and report.  

For this project, I focused on **Customer Analysis**, answering the key question:  
➡️ *Who are Zomato’s customers and what are their purchasing behaviors?*

- **restaurant** – Restaurant metadata  
- **users** – Customer demographics
