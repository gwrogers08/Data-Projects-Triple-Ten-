Superstore Returns Analysis
📊 Project Overview

This project investigates the root causes of high return rates at the Superstore and provides recommendations for reducing them. The analysis was prepared for the CEO to identify patterns, seasonal trends, customer behaviors, and financial impacts of returns.

The analysis was performed using Tableau, incorporating storytelling dashboards and interactive visualizations to highlight insights.

🎯 Business Question

What is causing the high number of returned orders at the Superstore?

🔑 Key Objectives

Identify the primary factors driving product returns.

Evaluate whether returns are influenced by sales volume, customer behavior, product category, geography, or seasonality.

Measure returns effectively (by return rate, cost of returns, or volume of returns).

Build an interactive dashboard to monitor returns and assist management in decision-making.

🛠 Tools & Techniques

Data Tool: Tableau

Techniques:

Data joins (Orders + Returns tables)

Calculated fields for return rate

Interactive dashboards with filters

Storytelling with Data framework

📊 Dashboard

The Tableau dashboard consolidated all key charts, enabling:

Drill-down into return rates by customer, category, and time.

Filters to identify root causes quickly.

Storytelling flow from overview → root causes → recommendations.




🧩 Key Findings

Customer Behavior → A small number of customers accounted for a significant share of costly returns.

Seasonality → Returns peaked in certain months, indicating a seasonal pattern.

Geography → Geographic impact was minimal compared to customer and seasonal effects.

Category → Product category had little direct impact on return rates.

Financial Impact → Some customers generated losses exceeding $20K in returns.

🚀 Recommendations

Monitor repeat high-return customers and develop policies to reduce abuse.

Offer seasonal promotions to reduce return rates during peak months.

Continue using the dashboard for ongoing monitoring and process improvements.

Focus efforts on profitability impact, not just return volume.
