# Superstore Returns Analysis

## 📊 Project Overview

This project investigates **the root causes of high return rates** at the Superstore and provides recommendations for reducing them. The analysis was prepared for the CEO to identify patterns, seasonal trends, customer behaviors, and financial impacts of returns.

The analysis was performed using **Tableau**, incorporating storytelling dashboards and interactive visualizations to highlight insights.

## 🎯 Business Question

**What is causing the high number of returned orders at the Superstore?**

## 🔑 Key Objectives

1. Identify the primary factors driving product returns.
2. Evaluate whether returns are influenced by sales volume, customer behavior, product category, geography, or seasonality.
3. Measure returns effectively (by return rate, cost of returns, or volume of returns).
4. Build an interactive dashboard to monitor returns and assist management in decision-making.

## 🛠 Tools & Techniques

* **Data Tool:** Tableau
* **Techniques:**

  * Data joins (Orders + Returns tables)
  * Calculated fields for return rate
  * Interactive dashboards with filters
  * Storytelling with Data framework

## 📈 Analysis & Visuals

The analysis included the following key visualizations:

* **Sales vs. Returns Scatterplot** → Correlation by product subcategory【5†Superstore Returns Analysis.pdf】
* **Return Rate by Category** → Comparison across Furniture, Office Supplies, and Technology【5†Superstore Returns Analysis.pdf】
* **Customer Return Rate** → Identifying high-return customers (with >1 order)【5†Superstore Returns Analysis.pdf】
* **Geographic Return Rate** → Map showing state-level variations【5†Superstore Returns Analysis.pdf】
* **Seasonal Trends** → Return rate by month and profit trends【5†Superstore Returns Analysis.pdf】
* **Profit Impact** → Cost of returns by customer【5†Superstore Returns Analysis.pdf】

## 📊 Dashboard

The Tableau dashboard consolidated all key charts, enabling:

* Drill-down into return rates by customer, category, and time.
* Filters to identify root causes quickly.
* Storytelling flow from **overview → root causes → recommendations**.

## 🧩 Key Findings

1. **Customer Behavior** → A small number of customers accounted for a significant share of costly returns.
2. **Seasonality** → Returns peaked in certain months, indicating a seasonal pattern.
3. **Geography** → Geographic impact was minimal compared to customer and seasonal effects.
4. **Category** → Product category had little direct impact on return rates.
5. **Financial Impact** → Some customers generated losses exceeding \$20K in returns.

## 🚀 Recommendations

* Monitor **repeat high-return customers** and develop policies to reduce abuse.
* Offer **seasonal promotions** to reduce return rates during peak months.
* Continue using the dashboard for **ongoing monitoring and process improvements**.
* Focus efforts on **profitability impact**, not just return volume.

## 📂 Project Deliverables

* Tableau Worksheets (scatterplots, bar charts, maps, time series)
* Dashboard (mock-ups, template, and final version)
* Story Arc & Presentation (with key findings and recommendations)
* PDF Report: [Superstore Returns Analysis](./Superstore%20Returns%20Analysis.pdf)

## 🎥 Presentation

Prepared a **3–5 minute Tableau Story presentation** demonstrating:

* Root causes of returns
* How to use the dashboard interactively
* Recommended next steps for management
