## ðŸ“‹ Requirements (Fine Print)

- **Data Assumptions**
  - Number of reviews used as a proxy for listing popularity.  
  - `0` in the `bedroom_clean` column represents a **studio**.  
  - Annual revenue estimated by multiplying **30-day revenue Ã— 12**.  
  - Calendar data only covers **30 days**, so scaling was required.  
  - A value of `1` in `top_listings` indicates the listing met investment criteria.  

- **Data Cleaning & Processing**
  - Standardized neighborhood names (`neighborhood_clean`) by trimming whitespace and formatting.  
  - Recoded bedrooms to clearly identify studios vs. multi-bedroom units.  
  - Added calculated fields for **top listings** and **revenue earned**.  
  - Created pivot tables for:
    - Top neighborhoods by reviews  
    - Bedroom distribution by neighborhood  
    - Revenue earned per listing
