# 🏙️ Manhattan Vacation Rental Market Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
You've been hired to help a client analyze the Manhattan vacation rental market.  
They want guidance on **which property types to invest in**, and your task is to analyze **Airbnb data** for insights.

This analysis answers two key questions:
1. Which **neighborhoods** and **property sizes** (number of bedrooms) are most attractive for vacation rentals?  
2. How much **revenue** do these listings generate annually?

## 📊 Data Sources
The analysis is based on **Inside Airbnb** datasets, including:
- **Listings data** (property details, host info, reviews, pricing)
- **Calendar data** (daily availability & pricing for 30 days)

---

## ⚙️ Methodology
- Cleaned and standardized neighborhood and bedroom data.
- Created pivot tables and aggregations for:
  - Top neighborhoods by number of reviews.
  - Bedroom distribution by neighborhood.
  - Revenue earned per property (scaled to annual revenue).
- Used **number of reviews** as a popularity proxy.
- Estimated **annual revenue** by multiplying 30-day earnings × 12.
