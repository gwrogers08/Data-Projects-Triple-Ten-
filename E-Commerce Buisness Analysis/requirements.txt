## ✅ Project Requirements

To successfully complete this project, the following requirements were set:

1. **Data Exploration**
   - Use the provided `raw_user_activity` dataset.  
   - Understand each column and its role in customer behavior analysis:
     - `user_id`, `event_type`, `category_code`, `brand`, `price`, `event_date`.

2. **Conversion Funnel**
   - Build a funnel showing:
     - Number of users who viewed a product page.  
     - Number who added an item to their shopping cart.  
     - Number who completed a purchase.  
   - Calculate **conversion rates** at each step.

3. **Cohort & Retention Analysis**
   - Group users by their **first purchase month**.  
   - Track each cohort’s activity for up to **4 months**.  
   - Calculate **retention rates** as:  
     \[
     \text{Retention Rate} = \frac{\text{Customers active in later month}}{\text{Customers in initial cohort}}
     \]

4. **Executive Summary**
   - Prepare a concise written report explaining:  
     - Key findings from the funnel and retention analysis.  
     - Business implications (why these insights matter).  
     - Recommendations for improving conversion and retention.  

5. **Tools & Methods**
   - Perform analysis in **Google Sheets or Excel**.  
   - Use **pivot tables, formulas, and charts** to calculate metrics.  
   - Present results clearly with tables and visualizations.

⚠️ **Fine Print**
- Do not drop columns unless justified — use as much of the dataset as possible.  
- Focus on **user-level analysis** (unique customers, not just events).  
- Insights should connect back to **business outcomes** (i.e., how the company can retain more customers or increase purchases).  
- Document all steps so findings are **transparent and reproducible**.
